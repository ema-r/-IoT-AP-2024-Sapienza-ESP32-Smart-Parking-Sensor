# Description of the main idea
i(L)ot is a smart IoT parking system that uses embedded devices that collect data on parking spots and analyzes them to understand useful information on their availability, on the status of the entire parking lot that contains them, analyzing for example which parking spots are favoured by the lot's user, at which hours and other general usage data.
Furthermore, this allows dynamic pricing schemes to be implemented according to a spot's popularity; for users to know which spots are free and the parking lot status beforehand.
